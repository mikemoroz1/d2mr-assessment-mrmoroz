# Unassessed Learning Objectives

1. use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown
2. find and understand documentation for R packages and functions
15. recognize and interpret common data visualizations
16. determine most appropriate visualizations and analyses for specific research questions and data

Everything is listed in association with each code chunk (in terms of what objective I believe I am demonstrating with each code chunk). All of my comments are marked with two '##'. If you have any questions please let me know! 

I am attempting to meet all of these marked objectives for the first time.
