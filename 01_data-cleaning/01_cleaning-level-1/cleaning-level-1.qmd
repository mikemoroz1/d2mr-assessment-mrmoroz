title: 'Level 1 Data Cleaning: Clean the mtcars Dataset'
---

# Objective

The objective of this assignment is to practice cleaning and transforming a messy data set using tidyverse functions. You will use skills like renaming and reordering columns, sorting rows, changing data types, mutating data, and using the stringr and forcats packages.

In this Level 1 Cleaning assignment, you will work with a simple data set and focus on basic data cleaning tasks. Most tasks are outlined in the assignment script. You may want to review the [Data Cleaning Walkthrough](https://github.com/nrdowling/d2mr-assessment/tree/main/01_data-cleaning/00_cleaning-walkthrough) before you begin.

You may additionally or alternatively complete the [Level 2 Data Cleaning assignment](https://github.com/nrdowling/d2mr-assessment/tree/main/01_data-cleaning/01_cleaning-level-2). In Level 2, you will work with a more complex data set and perform additional cleaning tasks with less direct instruction. The Level 2 assignment has more opportunities to demonstrating meeting course standards than this Level 1 assignment and is recommended for those who are already comfortable with the tasks in this assignment.

# Instructions

<<<<<<< HEAD
1.  If you have not already done so, pull the latest changes from the `d2mr-assignments` repository to ensure you have the most up-to-date version of the assignment files. Confirm you are working in your fork of the repository.
2.  Open `cleaning-level-1.qmd` in RStudio and follow the instructions in the Setup section below to load and inspect the (clean) `goal.mtcars` dataset.
    -   **Important:** The provided code makes a small modification to the original `mtcars` data set to create a `goal.mtcars` data set. You will use this goal data set as a reference to clean the `messy-mtcars.csv` data set, not the true original.
3.  Follow the tasks described in the assignment script to clean the data set and return it to its original state.
4.  At several points in this document you will come across questions or non-coding exercises. Answer these questions in the text of this .qmd document, immediately below the question.
5.  *Optional:* Continue to follow the instructions in the assignment script to clean the data set above and beyond matching the original.
=======

### Tasks

**Reminder:** Your goal is to match `goal.mtcars` (created below), *not* the default `mtcars`.[^1]

[^1]: Why? The `mtcars` data set includes models names as *row names* rather than as a variable/column. For the purposes of this cleaning exercise, it's more useful to treat model names as a variable.

1.  **Renaming Columns:** Rename columns to match the original `mtcars` data set column names.
2.  **Reordering Columns:** Ensure the columns are in the correct order.
3.  **Sorting Rows:** Sort the rows by `mpg` (miles per gallon) and then by `cyl` (number of cylinders).
4.  **Changing Data Types:** Ensure `gear` and `carb` are factors and other columns are numeric.
5.  **Mutating Data:** Create a new column `hp_per_cyl` calculated as `hp` (horsepower) divided by `cyl`.
6.  **String Manipulation:** Use `stringr` to clean any unwanted spaces or characters in the `model` column.
7.  **Handling Factors:** Use `forcats` to ensure the levels of `gear` are ordered as `3`, `4`, `5`.

# Setup

```

QUESTIONS:

1.  What are the differences between the messy data set and the original mtcars data set?

The messy data set has a car model column, has (Miles/Gallon) listed with mpg, and generally has longer column names like using "cylinders" vs "cyl" and "horsepower" vs "hp". The messy data set also has "wt + runif(n(), 2e-05, 2e-04)" and "hp_per_cyl" as column names that are not included in the original mtcars data set. Some of the columns also have different data types, with float/numeric data "<dbl>" being common in the original 'mtcars' data set, and character data "<chr>" being common in the 'messy.mtcars' data set. The original 'mtcars' data set also rounds the data to easier-to-read decimal points, whereas the 'messy.mtcar's data set does not and keeps the values in their full-length decimal points. We also have to abbreviate the 'messy.mtcars' column names so they properly match the 'goal.mtcars' column names. Finally, there is missing data in the cylinders and horsepower columns for the 'messy.mtcars' data set.

2.  What are the main issues you need to address in cleaning?

To get the 'messy.mtcars' data set to look like the 'goal.mtcars' data set, we have to drop the "wt + runif(n(), 2e-05, 2e-04)" and "hp_per_cyl" columns from the 'messy.mtcars' data set. We also need to label the car model column. Then we need to change the 'messy.mtcars' data set columns from character "<chr>" to float/numeric data "<dbl>". We also need to remove (Miles/Gallon) from the mpg column title/header, and fix the decimal rounding in each column so it matches the 'goal.mtcars' data set. Finally, we have to fill in the missing values for the cylinder and horsepower columns to properly match the 'goal.mtcars' data set. There might be other issues that need to be addressed that I've forgotten to list here, but I will comment those out in each code chunk (using '##') while I'm cleaning. This will be my standardized system for commenting so you can differentiate my logic/code from each code chunk's assignment prompt. 

I'm also going to list each objective that I think I've hit in each code chunk at the bottom. (This is not to get credit for repeats; but to simply state what I think each code chunk does in terms of hitting required objectives). 

# Clean the Dataset

## Create "clean" dataset

```{r}

#| label: make-cleaning-data-set

# Create a data set to work with during the cleaning process called "clean.mtcars"

clean.mtcars <- messy.mtcars

head(clean.mtcars)

```

## Clean columns/variables

```{r}

#| label: rename-columns

# Rename columns to match the original 'mtcars' data set

## From this point on my comments will be done using two '##'. All I'm doing here is comparing each data set and making changes as I see them. 

clean.mtcars <- messy.mtcars %>%
  rename(mpg=`mpg (Miles/Gallon)`, cyl = cylinders, hp = horsepower, gear = gearbox, carb = carburetors, disp = dsip) %>%
  column_to_rownames(" Car Model")

## I just changed each column to match the original 'mtcars' data set (including changing the "Car Model" column back to a row). I had to include one space before "Car Model" to make all the spacing fit properly.

head(clean.mtcars)

## Objective #10: Use dplyr and tidyr functions to transform data
## Unassessed Learning Objective #1: Use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown

```

```{r}

#| label: reorder-columns

# Reorder columns to match the original mtcars data set

clean.mtcars <- clean.mtcars %>% relocate(disp, .after = cyl)
head(clean.mtcars)

## Checking for equal columns. Not equal yet because I still have to drop two columns. 
## I assume we will be asked to drop them in the future. 

all.equal(colnames(clean.mtcars), colnames(mtcars))

## Not equal yet because I haven't dropped the columns. 

## Objective #10: Use dplyr and tidyr functions to transform data
## Unassessed Learning Objective #1: Use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown

```

```{r}

#| label: correct-data-types

# Correct variable data types

## So this is where I've run into a bit of confusion from the initial instructions compared to the instructions in each code chunk. If our primary goal is to match the 'mtcars' data set, then I will have to make changes that are different in the structure/nature than the initial tasks outlined from 1-7 above. I'm going to follow the instructions in each code chunk, so I just want to preface that my code/process might not totally follow in line with all the tasks/instructions listed above.

## Going back to this code again shortly before submitting, it appears this code was modified after I recently pulled from GitHub (and I probably started on this too early because I thought we were supposed to start with #1 from the list of mini-projects). So I just want to stress that this code might look different/follow different instructions from its updated version, but it should still hit the various goals and objectives required (just in a bit of a slightly different way). 

clean.mtcars <- clean.mtcars %>%
  mutate(mpg = as.numeric(mpg), cyl = as.numeric(cyl), disp = as.numeric(disp), hp = as.numeric(hp), drat = as.numeric(drat), wt = as.numeric(wt), qsec = as.numeric(qsec), vs = as.numeric(vs), am = as.numeric(am), gear = as.numeric(gear), carb = as.numeric(carb))

head(clean.mtcars)

## Everything matches 'mtcars' as far as column data types go. Time to move to the next step. 

## Objective #10: Use dplyr and tidyr functions to transform data
## Unassessed Learning Objective #1: Use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown

```

## Checkpoint 1

```{r}

#| label: checkpoint-1

# Inspect the current state of the dataset

head(clean.mtcars)

# Use all.equal() to check if clean.mtcars matches goal.mtcars

all.equal(clean.mtcars, goal.mtcars)

```

Questions:

3.  The current state of the data set does not yet match the `goal.mtcars` data set. Explain the issues that `all.equal()` flags. Are there groups of issues that can be addressed together?

Most of the flags refer to the unaddressed inconsistencies I mentioned before. For example, my 'clean.mtcars' data set still has two more columns than the 'goal.mtcars' data set, which will need to be dropped. Furthermore, my current 'clean.mtcars' dataset has car model listed as a row with no column, whereas 'goal.mtcars' has model as a column. Other than that, there are also rounding issues with some of the columns and their values which makes the means appear to be different, and there are also elements of missing data that will need to be addressed. Finally, the last issue I see is that some of the columns are still "characters" instead of being "numeric" in the 'clean.mtcars' data set, but those are the columns that need to be dropped anyways so I did not change them earlier.

3.  Install (if necessary) and load the `daff` package. In the code chunk below, use the `diff_data()` function to identify the differences between `clean.mtcars` and `goal.mtcars`.

```{r}
#| label: diff-data

# Install and/or load the daff package if needed
install.packages("daff")
library(daff)

# Use render_diff() and diff_data() to identify differences between clean.mtcars and goal.mtcars

render_diff(diff_data(clean.mtcars, goal.mtcars))

## Objective #5: Find, install, require, and load R packages

```

How is this method of identifying data discrepancies different from `all.equal()`? Which do you find more helpful at this point?

Using the render_diff function is way easier to identify data discrepancies than using all.equal(). The render_diff function creates a nice table that is simple and easy to read. I find the render_diff function to be more helpful than the all.equal() line of code.

## Clean data values

Identifying specific value problems and cleaning them might take a little creativity at times! Use the troubleshooting/debugging workflows we've discussed to get as far as you can.

```{r}

#| label: impute-missing-values

# Impute missing values for cyl and hp

## I'm just going to do this manually. I'm checking the correct value of each cell, then manually inputting that value here. I like this way to work with the data, but it only works if there are minor issues that need to be fixed. For something crazy with 100,000+ rows of unclean data, I would use a for loop and change it that way. Nevertheless, simple is still good! 

clean.mtcars$cyl[15] = 8
clean.mtcars$cyl[30] = 6

clean.mtcars$hp[9] = 95
clean.mtcars$hp[18] = 66
clean.mtcars$hp[27] = 91

## Checking my results

library(daff)
render_diff(diff_data(clean.mtcars, goal.mtcars))

## Unassessed Learning Objective #1: Use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown
```

```{r}

#| label: round-numeric-values

# Round numeric values

## Again I'm just checking what each value needs to be/look like, then implementing that below in my code.

clean.mtcars <- clean.mtcars %>%
  mutate(disp = round(disp, 1), drat = round(drat, 2), qsec = round(qsec, 2))

library(daff)
render_diff(diff_data(clean.mtcars, goal.mtcars))

## Everything looks good. Now I just need to fix the model column so that it's a column again. 

## Objective #10: Use dplyr and tidyr functions to transform data
## Unassessed Learning Objective #1: Use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown

```

```{r}

#| label: Adding 'model' back as a column name.

## I have to add model back as a column name first so I'm going to do this a little differently. 

clean.mtcars = clean.mtcars %>% rownames_to_column(var = "model")

head(clean.mtcars)

library(daff)
render_diff(diff_data(clean.mtcars, goal.mtcars))

## Everything looks good. Model is back as a column name. 

## Objective #10: Use dplyr and tidyr functions to transform data
## Unassessed Learning Objective #1: Use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown

```

```{r}

#| label: fix-typos

# Fix typos in model names
# Remove unwanted whitespace in any columns required
## Hint: This can be completed with a 6-line mutate() statement

## Due to the way I've coded so far, I was unable to fit all the changes in a 6-line mutate() statement. My code is a bit longer, but this is the most efficient method I found so far. I tried to do it in less steps but simply couldn't, and if I wanted to I'd have to go back and change the way I've coded up until this point. For time purposes, I will take the note and do it in the future.  

clean.mtcars <- clean.mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    model = str_squish(model),
    model = str_replace_all(model, "SportAbout", "Sportabout"),
    model = str_replace_all(model, "CAdillac", "Cadillac"),
    model = str_replace_all(model, "ToyotA|T0yota", "Toyota"),
    model = str_replace_all(model, "L0tus", "Lotus"),
    model = str_replace_all(model, "FerrAri", "Ferrari"),
    model = str_replace_all(model, "PontiAc", "Pontiac")
  )

library(daff)
render_diff(diff_data(clean.mtcars, goal.mtcars))

## Everything looks good!

## Objective #10: Use dplyr and tidyr functions to transform data
## Objective #11: Use stringr functions to work with string variables
## Unassessed Learning Objective #1: Use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown

```

```{r}

#| label: remove-extra-column

# Remove the extra columns

## This is pretty simple; just going to use the select function as part of dplyr and drop the extra columns. 

clean.mtcars = clean.mtcars %>% select(-c("wt + runif(n(), 2e-05, 2e-04)", hp_per_cyl))

head(clean.mtcars)

library(daff)
render_diff(diff_data(clean.mtcars, goal.mtcars))

## Everything looks good. 

## Objective #10: Use dplyr and tidyr functions to transform data
## Unassessed Learning Objective #1: Use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown

```

## Checkpoint 2

```{r}
#| label: checkpoint-2

# Inspect the data set and compare to goal.mtcars

# all.equal()

all.equal(clean.mtcars, goal.mtcars)

# daff

library(daff)
render_diff(diff_data(clean.mtcars, goal.mtcars))

## Both are equal. Output = True and the data frames line up perfectly with each other (even if I used a bit of an unconventional method to get to this point!)

## Testing a logical operator to compare values across index position 1 between 'mpg' columns of each data set to get a further look into the data. 

logical = clean.mtcars$mpg[1]|goal.mtcars$mpg[1]
print(logical)

# Again, everything looks good! I'm happy with how it looks now at this point.

Questions:

5.  Is your data set identical to `goal.mtcars`? If not, what are the remaining issues? If there were any issues you could not resolve in code, describe a proposed solution in plain English.

My 'clean.mtcars' data set is identical to 'goal.mtcars', so everything worked out quite well. I found I had to use a bit of a different order/process compared to the outline, but everything worked out quite well! Mostly this was due to me not having made 'model' a column earlier, and if I did that earlier in my code I could've followed the outline perfectly. Nevertheless, I am happy with how everything turned out and I got 'clean.mtcars' to look like 'goal.mtcars', which is what it's supposed to look like! Coding never seems to be a linear process. 

# Optional Cleaning Tasks

You can call it a day here, or continue with the optional cleaning tasks below. These tasks are a chance to challenge yourself and practice your skills further. They are also additional opportunities to demonstrate mastery of course standards!

## Additional guided cleaning

*Optional:* Complete any number of the following tasks to further clean the dataset. Each task should be in its own code chunk with an appropriate label and clearly commented code:

1.  Create a new factor column `mpg_category` that categorizes `mpg` into "low", "medium", and "high" based on the distribution of `mpg` values.

```{r}

#| label: Additional Task #1: 'mpg_category'

# Making 'mpg_category'

## First checking to see the distribution of 'mpg' values using ggplot2
## Code reference: https://pyoflife.com/creating-a-normal-distribution-plot-using-ggplot2-in-r/#google_vignette

## ?ggplot2
## install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

## Now I can plot so that I can see the distribution of the data. This is how I normally do things; I always plot first if I know I have clean data. 

ggplot(clean.mtcars, aes(x = mpg)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1.5, color = "darkgreen", fill = "lightgreen") + labs(x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)", y = "Number of Cars", title = "Miles per Gallon Histogram", subtitle = "Figure 1") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

## The histogram distribution tells me a bit (it's positively skewed using 1.5 mpg binwidths), but I'm going to do a second check by making three cutoff bins and checking those distributions. The work is not done yet! And I'm also going to keep using ggplot because it's my favourite thing in R.

binned_mpg = cut_interval(clean.mtcars$mpg, n = 3)
print(binned_mpg)

## Parse and define conditional statement (below)
## Ok this second piece of info tells me a bit more than the first. This code looks at all the values in mpg and cuts it into three different categories depending on the distribution of the data. The cutoffs are as follows: < 18.2 = low, > 18.2 but < 26.1 = medium, > 26.1 = high). Time to do that in the code to modify my data frame. 

## Using an if/else loop to make a new column categorizing the data
## Code reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67943039/apply-if-else-condition-to-make-new-column-in-r

clean.mtcars$mpg_category <- with(clean.mtcars, ifelse(mpg < 18.2, "low", ifelse(mpg < 26.1, "medium", "high")))

print(clean.mtcars)

## Okay everything seemed to work out. If a car's mpg is < 18.2, it now has 'low' mpg in the 'mpg_category' column. If a car's mpg is > 18.2 but < 26.1, it now has 'medium' mpg in the 'mpg_category' column. Finally, if a car's mpg is > 26.1, it now has 'high' mpg in the 'mpg_category' column. This is just one potential way to group/classify the data, but I am happy with how everything turned out!

## Objective #6: Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
## Objective #8: Parse and write conditional statements and/or loops
## Objective #13: Produce 1- and 2-variable plots with geom_* layers (1-variable below)
## Objective #16: Create publication-quality plots using theme and labs layers
## Unassessed Learning Objective #1: Use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown

```

2.  Create a new factor column `wt_category` that categorizes `wt` into "light", "medium", and "heavy" based on the distribution of `wt` values, then reverse the order of the levels.

```{r}

#| label: Additional Task #2: 'wt_category'

## I'm going to follow a similar version of the steps/processes I used before, with some slight modifications so I can try to hit more objectives. But I'm not exactly sure what the second part of the code is asking - reverse the order of the levels? Does this mean do that within the data frame's corresponding column using the reverse function? I think that's what it means, so I will do that and sort the data frame in descending order. 

## Loading packages

library(ggplot2)

## Plotting

ggplot(clean.mtcars, aes(x = wt)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = "darkblue", fill = "lightblue") + labs(x = "Car Weight (binwidth = 0.5)", y = "Number of Cars", title = "Car Weight Histogram", subtitle = "Figure 2") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

## Looking at the distribution, using binwidths of 0.5 makes the data appear to fit that of a normal distribution. There are obviously other techniques/modifications I can make to this plot, but it gives me a good sense of how the data is distributed. I want more information so I'm going to get summary/descriptive statistics that will better inform me of the data's distribution. 

## Calculating descriptive statistics. These are just some of the common descriptives I have been told to calculate in the past, so I'm using that as my basic framework here. Most of them won't be important, but they could be informative! 

## These lines each provide a different piece of data that could be informative about the data's distribution. I normally use summary() but wanted to show individual lines below. 

wt_mean = mean(clean.mtcars$wt)
wt_sd = sd(clean.mtcars$wt)
wt_var = var(clean.mtcars$wt)
wt_min = min(clean.mtcars$wt)
wt_max = max(clean.mtcars$wt)
wt_median = median(clean.mtcars$wt)
wt_lbq = quantile(clean.mtcars$wt, 0.25)
wt_ubq = quantile(clean.mtcars$wt, 0.75)
wt_iqr = IQR(clean.mtcars$wt)

## Using summary is just more efficient and what I normally use, but I wanted to show that I know how to look for individual descriptives (if necessary).

summary(clean.mtcars$wt)

## Ok so for my sorting bounds: +/- 1 standard deviation from the mean will suffice (because the mean and median are quite close). -1 standard deviation from the mean will represent the "light" category, and 1 standard deviation above the mean will represent the "heavy" category. Everything else will fall in the medium category. This is just another way to look at and represent the data. 

lower_bound = (wt_mean - wt_sd)
upper_bound = (wt_mean + wt_sd)

## Going to do this using a similar ifelse statement I used before because it's easier than typing everything in manually (and definitely more efficient!). Code is referenced in the above chunk (if needed). I'm not sure if you want us to reference code sources like StackOverflow, but I do it because it's a helpful practice for me as a coder when analyzing data. 

clean.mtcars$wt_category <- with(clean.mtcars, ifelse(wt < lower_bound, "light", ifelse(wt < upper_bound, "medium", "heavy")))

print(clean.mtcars)

## Ok everything worked out. Now I need to sort the data frame in descending order, and I can do this using the rev() function or the order function. I went googling and I like the order function so I'm going to use that. Attached is the code reference: https://www.datacamp.com/doc/r/sorting# 

## First I need to make the proper weights. Then I need to add the rest of the code. 

clean.mtcars$wt_category <- factor(clean.mtcars$wt_category, levels = c("heavy", "medium", "light"), ordered = TRUE)

attach(clean.mtcars)

reversed_weight = clean.mtcars[order(wt_category),]

## Or a better alternative (and my preferred alternative) is below. But I'm not using that here. 

## reversed_weight = clean.mtcars[order(-wt),]

print(reversed_weight)

detach(clean.mtcars)

## Now everything is sorted in descending leveled order from "heavy" to "medium" to "light" in the "reversed_weight" data set. I think a better method would be to sort by descending weight, as the current iteration of the code doesn't take actual weight into account, but that's alright. I think I did what you are asking!

```

3.  Create a new column `mpg_per_cyl` that calculates `mpg` divided by `cyl`.

```{r}

#| label: Additional Task #3: 'mpg_per_cyl'

## This will be relatively straightforward. I just have to make a column that takes 'mpg' and divides it by 'cyl' for each row. I will do that now.

## Example of arithmetic operator

clean.mtcars$mpg_per_cyl <- (clean.mtcars$mpg / clean.mtcars$cyl)

## Everything worked! It took each car's 'mpg' value, divided it by its 'cyl' value, and added it to the newly-made 'mpg_per_cyl' column. Pretty simple and straightforward. 

## Objective #6: Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
## Unassessed Learning Objective #1: Use frequent, informative comments in code and markdown

```

4.  Filter the data to only include cars with automatic transmissions. (Hint: `?mtcars` will show you useful info.)

```{r}

#| label: Additional Task #4: 'Automatic Transmissions'

?mtcars

## From the above line of code, I see the 'am' column corresponds to whether a car has an automatic or manual transmission. 0 is coded as automatic, so I only want rows with 0 in the 'am' column to be included in my new data set. 

## Now I just need to select for those values, which I will do in the code below using subset() 
## Code reference: https://www.r-bloggers.com/2024/06/remove-rows-from-dataframe-based-on-condition-in-r/#:~:text=To%20remove%20rows%2C%20use%20a,indices%20you%20want%20to%20exclude.&text=In%20this%20code%20snippet%2C%20we,their%20positions%20within%20negative%20brackets.

automatic_mtcars <- subset(clean.mtcars, am == 0)

print(automatic_mtcars)

## Everything looks good. Now the only cars in the newly created 'automatic_mtcars' data set have 'am' = 0 as one of their values.

```

5.  Identify which variable would be better suited as a logical variable, then convert it to logical.

```{r}

#| label: Additional Task #5: 'Logical Variable'

## I think this question is pretty open-ended because it's simply a matter of preference. For this question I'm going to pick the 'carb' variable and turn it into a logical variable. On the basis of my conversion: Are there more than 3 carburetors? 1 = Yes, 0 = No. I will do that now in my code below. 

## Example of comparison operator
## Then this is also another example of a conditional statement. 

clean.mtcars$carb <- with(clean.mtcars, ifelse(carb <= 3, 0, ifelse(carb > 3, 1, "NA")))
clean.mtcars$carb = as.numeric(mtcars$carb)

print(clean.mtcars)

## It worked! I used an ifelse statement again because I thought it was the most convenient. If carb <= 3, it becomes a 0 which means no, the car does not have more than 3 carburetors. If carb > 3, it becomes a 1 which means yes, the car does have more than 3 carburetors. Then I just had to assign an "NA" to handle all other cases (which is not used regardless). It worked out quite well.

6.  Sort the dataset by `mpg_category` then reverse alphabetically by `model` (so that models with the same `mpg_category` are sorted Z to A).

```{r}

#| label: Additional Task #6: 'Reverse Alphabetically'

## This can be done using a similar version of the steps I completed above (a couple code chunks ago). The code reference is attached in that initial code chunk, but this time I'm going to use the -rank function because it is easy to use to reverse sort the alphabet.

clean.mtcars$mpg_category <- factor(clean.mtcars$mpg_category, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"), ordered = TRUE)

reverse_alphabetical = clean.mtcars[order(clean.mtcars$mpg_category, -rank(clean.mtcars$model)), ]

head(reverse_alphabetical)

## Everything appears to have worked out. I had to use -rank to order the model column in reverse alphabetical order because decreasing = TRUE did not work. Everything looks in order in the reverse_alphabetical data set.

## Everything worked out! A minor hiccup is that two columns (which I created as ordinal character variables in additional questions #1 and #2) didn't save the ordinal specification and are just considered as 'character' variables in the new data set, but that's fine. I did a bit of googling and they won't match unless I re-specify my ordered preference,  but since they are both character variables across both data sets I think it's fine (the data structure didn't change, just its rank order). I can fix this with one line of code, but I think the nature of this question is making sure all your data translates properly. It did that for me here. I could've also just made a new data set for the additional questions but I decided to keep modifying the old one. If I made a new data set for each additional question, I wouldn't have run into this minor hiccup. But I'm happy with how everything turned out.

## Unguided cleaning and transformation

*Optional:* If you have the time and interest, continue transforming this dataset as you please. Create new columns based on the existing ones, reformat strings, try your hand at a regex replacement, summarize by groups (factor levels), visualize a simple relationship, or anything else you can think of. You can do this in addition to or instead of the suggested additional cleaning tasks above.

```{r}

#| label: Unguided Cleaning #1: 'forcats and more plots'

## Now I'm going to use the forcats package to do some additional data manipulation, then I'm going to make a two-variable plot (because I've already made some one-variable plots before) so I can check off two more objectives. 

## First I'm going to create a new data frame

unguided_data = clean.mtcars
# head(unguided_data)

## Now I'm going to use the forcats package to make some data modifications
## Code reference: https://forcats.tidyverse.org 

unguided_data$mpg_category = fct_lump_n(unguided_data$mpg_category, n = 2)
print(unguided_data)

## Ok everything worked out. I used the forcats package to lump all the 'high' values from the 'mpg_category' variable into "Other", based on wanting to make two groups of the most common frequencies between "low", "medium", and "high" values. I like forcats because it is fun to use for data manipulation.

## Summary/descriptives for this factor data:

summary(unguided_data$mpg_category)

## It won't calculate averages because the column is a character column; it just returns what values are present in the data set and how many there are. But if I want averages for 'mpg' I can simply do that, which I will do below:

summary(unguided_data$mpg)

## Comparing with a summary for the whole data set (to hit objective #17)

summary(unguided_data)

## This is a bit more informative. Basing this interpretation on the median and mean 'mpg', most cars in this data set are at or near around 20 miles per gallon. 

## Moving ahead - going to make some two variable plots now with ggplot2. 

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(unguided_data, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) + geom_line(na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = TRUE, color = "black") + labs(x = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)", y = "Car Weight (wt)", title = "Comparison Plot between Miles per Gallon (mpg) and Car Weight (wt)", subtitle = "Figure 3") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + geom_point()

## I like this plot even though it's not the most informative. It shows a general trend: the heavier the car, the lower its rate of miles per gallon. This is a fun way to represent some of the data with a two-variable line plot, where each point on the line represents a different car. This is a good way to visualize the relationship between two different data points (and their corresponding measurement systems) so I can better understand the overarching relationship between each category. It is quite fun!

#| label: Unguided Cleaning #2: 'Simple Hypothesis Testing and Presenting/Interpreting Statistics in a Manuscript Narrative '

## Ok now I'm going to do some simple hypothesis testing. T-tests will suffice here because I am going to make comparisons between two different group means. I will also use boxplots because I find they most effectively display different distributions/relationships across two comparison variables. 

## Hypothesis: Mazda car models have higher miles per gallon than Merc car models
## Null Hypothesis: Mazda car models do not have higher miles per gallon than Merc car models

## To test this hypothesis, I need to calculate the mean miles per gallon for each car model, then do a t-test of the comparison between both group means. I might not have a strong enough sample size to detect any effects. Regardless, I will try to detect any difference below: 

## First I'm going to extract the car model name and average the miles per gallon for each car model name. I'm following a similar process to what was used in the slides - I'm specifically filtering the 'model' column to only include everything before the first space in each cell. This will take the first part of each car model's name so that I can summarize and compare 'mpg' between cars.
# Code reference: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/t-tests-r-tutorial 

first_hypothesis_testing <- unguided_data %>%
  mutate(car_type = sub(" .*", "", model)) %>% 
  filter(car_type %in% c("Mazda", "Merc"))

t_test = t.test(mpg ~ car_type, data = first_hypothesis_testing)

t_test

## Boxplots

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(first_hypothesis_testing, aes(x = car_type, y = mpg)) + geom_boxplot(na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = TRUE, color = "black") + labs(x = "Car Type (Mazda vs. Merc)", y = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)", title = "Boxplot between Car Type and Miles per Gallon (n.s.)", subtitle = "Figure 4") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

## The difference between group means for 'mpg' between Mazda and Merc car models is not significant: t(6) = 1.55, p = 0.17, 95% CI [-1.15, 5.13]

## Second example of simple hypothesis testing, but with a non-numeric type of data: wt_category
## Hypothesis: 'Light' cars have higher miles per gallon (mpg) than 'heavy' cars
## Null Hypothesis: 'Light' cars do not have higher miles per gallon (mpg) than 'heavy' cars. 

second_hypothesis_testing <- unguided_data %>%
  filter(wt_category %in% c("light", "heavy"))

t_test_2 = t.test(mpg ~ wt_category, data = second_hypothesis_testing)

t_test_2

## Boxplots

ggplot(second_hypothesis_testing, aes(x = wt_category, y = mpg)) + geom_boxplot(na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = TRUE, color = "black") + labs(x = "Weight Category (heavy vs. light)", y = "Miles per Gallon (mpg)", title = "Boxplot between Weight Category and Miles per Gallon (p < 0.001)", subtitle = "Figure 5") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

## The second hypothesis was confirmed. 'Light' cars have higher miles per gallon (mpg) than 'heavy' cars: t(4) = -9.69, p < 0.001, 95% C.I. [11.83, 30.07].  

## Now I'm going to write the results up under this code chunk in a manuscript narrative.

```

A Welch two-samples t-test was conducted to assess differences in miles per gallon between Mazda (n = 2) and Merc (n = 7) car models. Mazda and Merc car models were found to not vary significantly across miles per gallon, t(6) = 1.55, p = 0.17, 95% C.I. [-1.15, 5.13]. These results provide evidence in support of the null hypothesis; that there are no significant differences between miles per gallon (mpg) group means for Mazda and Merc car models.  

A second Welch two-samples t-test was conducted to assess differences in miles per gallon between light (n = 6) and heavy (n = 3) cars. Light and heavy cars were found to vary significantly across miles per gallon, t(4) = -9.69, p < 0.001, 95% C.I. [11.83, 30.07]. These results provide evidence in support of the alternative hypothesis; that there are significant differences in miles per gallon (mpg) between light and heavy cars, with light cars having considerably higher miles per gallon than heavy cars.
